            <h5>SalesPage Technologies 2019 - Present</h5>
            <p>
              In my current role as a Solutions Analyst in Kalamazoo, Michigan,
              I've had the privilege of contributing to the growth and
              efficiency of SalesPage Resolution Services. Over the past year,
              I've been instrumental in designing and implementing innovative
              processes to assist fellow solution analysts in onboarding onto
              the platform. Additionally, I've played a pivotal role in
              addressing client needs through comprehensive research, meticulous
              analysis, and creative problem-solving. My skillset in areas such
              as Product Requirements, Data Mapping, and SalesPage Enterprise
              has proven to be invaluable in this role, allowing me to excel in
              providing top-notch solutions to clients and colleagues alike.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prior to this role, I served as an Associate Solution Analyst for
              three years, where I undertook substantial projects with
              remarkable success. Notably, I led the asset manager Nuveen
              through a significant upgrade to the latest version of SalesPage
              Enterprise, simultaneously crafting requirements for seamless
              integration with their Salesforce environment. Furthermore, I
              played a vital role in introducing Nuveen to new services such as
              LumaSuite, Advisor Atlas, and SalesPage Resolution Services. My
              ability to navigate Product Requirements, Data Mapping, and
              SalesPage Enterprise played a pivotal role in driving these
              accomplishments.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before stepping into the role of Associate Solution Analyst, I
              served as an Associate Business Analyst for six months, where I
              honed my skills in writing business requirements and responding to
              new client requests. One standout achievement during this period
              was my role in upgrading Ivy Investments' SalesPage Enterprise
              from an older version to a current one while preserving
              customizations tailored to their specific needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              My journey with SalesPage Technologies began as a Business Analyst
              Intern for three months, during which I gained valuable insights
              into the asset management industry and the innovative solutions
              SalesPage Technologies offers for marketing and sales big data
              challenges. With my skill set in SalesPage Enterprise, I laid the
              foundation for my subsequent roles and contributions to the
              organization.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout these experiences, I've consistently demonstrated my
              proficiency in handling complex projects, understanding client
              needs, and delivering innovative solutions, solidifying my role as
              a dedicated and effective professional in the world of solutions
              and business analysis.

            <p>
              My first project was operating the particle accelerator where I
              recorded data while fixing issues with the vacuum, contamination,
              and the measurement apparatus. My work involved time to amplitude
              converters, digital to analog converters, oscilloscopes,
              semiconductor devices, x-ray detectors, amplifiers,
              per-amplifiers, vacuum technologies and a complete knowledge of
              radiation safety.
            </p>

            <p>
              From October 2018 to May 2019 I worked in the solid-state physics
              lab, where I synthesize unusual materials and test them for
              superconductivity. Work includes designing growth protocols for
              materials, programming furnaces for crystal growth, and
              researching materials for safety and possible hazards. I developed
              a process for producing solid Lead-Sulfide crystals and refined
              them for extensive superconductivity testing.

            </div>

            <h5>D&L Industrial Services 2011 - 2017</h5>
            <p>
              During my tenure as the Head Custodian at D&L Industrial Services
              Inc., spanning an impressive six years, I assumed a pivotal role
              in ensuring the safety and cleanliness of Kalamazoo Public
              Schools. My responsibilities encompassed a wide array of critical
              tasks, and I demonstrated a high level of proficiency in various
              aspects of custodial management.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this role, I not only oversaw the daily operations of
              maintaining a clean and safe environment but also exhibited
              expertise in the operation of heavy floor cleaning equipment. My
              comprehensive knowledge extended to various methods of cleaning
              and refinishing floors, including those constructed of Wood, VCT
              (Vinyl Composition Tile), Terrazzo, and more. This versatility in
              floor maintenance allowed me to address the unique needs of
              different floor types, ensuring their optimal appearance and
              longevity.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the hallmarks of my contribution was my ability to
              orchestrate and manage large-scale deep cleaning projects. These
              initiatives required meticulous planning, resource allocation, and
              the supervision of a dedicated team. I consistently demonstrated
              leadership in these endeavors, ensuring that each project was
              executed with precision and completed on schedule.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my six-year tenure as the Head Custodian, I exemplified
              a commitment to upholding the highest standards of cleanliness and
              safety within Kalamazoo Public Schools. My profound understanding
              of custodial processes, coupled with my hands-on expertise in
              floor maintenance and project management, contributed
              significantly to the overall quality and efficiency of custodial
              services provided.
            </p>
            <p>
              My time as Head Custodian at D&L Industrial Services Inc. served
              as a testament to my dedication, professionalism, and ability to
              excel in a demanding and critical role, ultimately making a
              substantial impact on the cleanliness and safety of the
              educational environment at Kalamazoo Public Schools.
